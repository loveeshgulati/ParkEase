    GET  /api/v1/spots/{id}       (get spot info + price)
    PUT  /api/v1/spots/{id}/reserve
    PUT  /api/v1/spots/{id}/occupy
    PUT  /api/v1/spots/{id}/release

RabbitMQ (MassTransit):
  Published:  BookingCreatedEvent, BookingCancelledEvent
              BookingCheckedInEvent, BookingCheckedOutEvent
              BookingExpiredEvent, BookingExtendedEvent
              BookingsCancelledForUserEvent (saga response)
              BookingCancellationFailedEvent (saga compensation)

  Consumed:   CancelBookingsForUserCommand (from AccountDeactivationSaga)
              DriverDeletedEvent (cascade cancel bookings)
```
